All Night Nippon Level Select Patch v1
-----------------------------------

This patch adds a level select to All Night Nippon Super Mario Brothers.

It should be applied to an All Night Nippon FDS, sha1 f30bdd3c556604d7eaa6d0f4864d5566e519b5d4

You can use this to check the sha1 of your fds file: https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/sha1_checksum.html

In general everything is the same as https://github.com/threecreepio/smb2j-glitchedworlds so you can check it for more notes.
